    <p>Vegeta is born around Age 732. His father, King Vegeta, was the king of the Saiyan race. Vegeta and his race are also under the rule of the interplanetary warlord Frieza, and King Vegeta was also forced by Frieza to surrender him to the latter through undisclosed means. While under Frieza's grip, Vegeta was pressured by Frieza to do his bidding or else Frieza would murder Vegeta's father. In his youth, Vegeta saw his father being stepped over by the God of Destruction Beerus.[10] In Battle of Gods, Vegeta doesn't try to assist his father but in Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta attempts to help but he gets paralyzed by Beerus, restraining him from moving. </p>
